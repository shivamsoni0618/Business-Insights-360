# Business-Insights-360
To develop a comprehensive report that offers deep insights into AtliQ Hardware's operational performance, powered by the cutting-edge capabilities of Power BI.

From detailed profit and loss statements to customer and product performance analyses, our project encompasses five dynamic dashboards:
1.Finance Dashboard: Delve into detailed P&L statements, track metrics like Gross Margin and Net Profit, and gain insights through time-based performance analysis.
2.Sales Dashboard: Uncover customer and product performance trends, evaluate unit economics, and make data-driven decisions based on the dashboard.
3.Marketing Dashboard: Gain insights into regional and product performance, assess unit economics, and visualize metrics in terms of Net Sales and Gross Margin percentage.
4.Supply Chain Dashboard: Explore forecast accuracy, Net Error trends, and key metrics related to customers and products for enhanced supply chain management.
5.Executive Dashboard: Compare market share against competitors, analyze revenue breakdowns, and highlight top-performing customers and products for strategic planning.

Throughout this project, I've utilized advanced Power BI functionalities such as:
➡️ Created DAX measures to find important info in data.
➡️ Used KPI indicators to quickly see if things are good or bad
➡️ Made titles that change depending on what you're looking at
➡️ Added buttons to make it easy to move around in the report
➡️ Excelled in sculpting data models 
➡️ Incorporating bookmarks for seamless visual transitions
➡️ Made the visuals stand out by coloring them based on what they showed.

Each of these skills helped me build a powerful Power BI project that makes it easier to understand data and make decisions.
